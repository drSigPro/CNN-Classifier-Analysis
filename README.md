# Lab for exploring existing CNN architectures in [torchvision models](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html), Fine tuning and transfer learning to classify birds in [CUB-200-2011 dataset](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/) and Explain models through feature visualization and understanding

The lab has three parts with homeworks for each part. All the parts are to be done in Google Colab and the reference notebooks are appended in the parts below.

# Part 1: Compare the various ImageNET models for accuracy (1% and 5%), memory requirements, inference time and floating point operations (FLOPS)



TBD
